# time_varying_GT

this is for the main result and sensitivity part of the manuscript. 
For some initial rda data due to larger than 25MB cannot be uploaded, I have provided the results recorded in csv form.
The data uploaded in this folder correspond to this folder's r codes that need them to reproduce the results/plots
