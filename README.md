# time_varying_GT

folder main_code and main_data are for the main result and sensitivity part of the manuscript. 
folder correlation_IP_GT and simulation correspond to the other two parts of the manuscript.
For some initial rda data due to larger than 25MB cannot be uploaded in the same folder, I have provided the results recorded in csv form.
the data saved in folder "main_data" were used in the codes saved in folder "main_code"
In the other two folders I did not further put code and data into separate folders, as they were less than those for main results.


Note in some codes they refer loading an rda file,
but following the code you can create the rda by yourself
or you can refer to the release (click "tag") where I have put the most frequently loaded rda data in my codes
