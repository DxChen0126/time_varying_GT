# time_varying_GT

this is for the main result and sensitivity part of the manuscript. 
For some initial rda data due to larger than 25MB cannot be uploaded in the same folder, I have provided the results recorded in csv form.
The data uploaded in this folder correspond to this folder's r codes that need them to reproduce the results/plots

Note in some codes they refer loading an rda file,
but following the code you can create the rda by yourself
or you can refer to the release where I have put the most frequently loaded rda data in my codes
