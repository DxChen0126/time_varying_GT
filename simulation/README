This folder contains data and code for simulation under the assumption that GT and IP are independent
We tested with differet GT setting and exposure window width
Note in some codes they refer loading an rda file, which is too large to upload in the same folder
but following the code you can create the rda by yourself
or you can refer to the release where I have put the most frequently loaded rda data in my codes
