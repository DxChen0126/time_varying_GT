In this folder and data and codes are for estimating GT under the assumption that
IP of infector and GT are correlated
Note in some codes they refer loading an rda file, which is too large to upload in the same folder
but following the code you can create the rda by yourself
or you can refer to the release where I have put the most frequently loaded rda data in my codes
